#Hello World in Java

__Notes:__  
* First part of file name must match class name, case sensitive
* To run the class from the console, we need a method called Main
* 'static' means that this is a member of the class that can be called from the class itself as opposed to a class instance
* *Notice:* Main vs main
* name of method + arguments = method signature
* Required main method signature receives an array of strings
* Classes are typically organized in packages
* A package is a unique identifier that goes at the top of the class declaration but it actually matches a folder hierarchy

__Sample Run:__  
> javac com\example\java\Main.java  
> java com.example.java.Main potato  
> java com.example.java.Main "potato lemon"
